## Project - Fall of the Empire

You got access to the Empire Meeting System (EMS by ACME Microsystemsâ„¢), the rebels intelligence elaborate a plan to defeat the empire by eliminating all the leadership with one great attack. 

Then you need to create a new event on the EMS to bring everyone together in the same place, at the same time. For it, you need to find a date/time that all of the 6 members can stay physically on the same solar system.
